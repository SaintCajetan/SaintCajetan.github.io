        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p> To utilize my customer service skills, experience gained from previous careers, and coding skills gained from making Roblox games as a hobbyist to obtain employment with thunder::tech as a Web Development Apprentice.  I believe my evergreen desire to gather technical knowledge, and the experience gained while working in this position will be the catalysts to the launch of a successful career in Tech.  </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Enthusiastic individual with passions for technology and helping others. I have a proficient understanding of Lua and I am currently enrolled in the Google IT Support Professional Certificate Program on Coursera.
