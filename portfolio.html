    <p>This video showcases the functionality of a Roblox game I have been working on for the last few weeks.</p>

    <p>Hold shift is speed boost | Collecting hands gives you the power needed to hold the ball | When close to the ball hold down left click to hold the ball.</p>

    <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/10471687180/Wizard-League">Play the game here</a>

    <p>You most likely will have to create an account and download Roblox</p>

    <p> I used existing code as a base to create the system that allows you to fly on around on the broom. I wrote code that plays animations so that flying looks more realistic. When you hold down the shift key, the player's character moves forward as if they're leaning in to gather speed. The shift key also triggers the player's character to speed up, and the player's camera zooms in to simulate tunnel vision created by flying at a higher speed. When the player moves their mouse the code detects the mouse movement delta.x. If the value of x is > .87 an animation is played to simulate the character turning left. If the value is < -.87 an animation is played to simulate the character turning right. </p>

    <p>There is code within the game that detects what team the player is on to change the color of the trail of their broom. This code is also used to display the player in the pause menu are a player on the purple or orange team and ensure that the player spawns on the correct side of the field. </p>

    <p>When a goal is scored, each player who did not score has the object of their camera changed to the scoring player's character. The scoring player's name is then displayed.</p>

    <p>I created this game using LUA. There are approximately 1000 lines of code, if not more.</p>
