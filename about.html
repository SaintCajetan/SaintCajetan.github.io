    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am an aspiring developer currently living in Brunswick, Ohio.
        In 2018, I began creating games on Roblox after watching my son using
        the company's game engine. When I started that journey, I figured I would
        learn a few cool things to show my children and bond with them threw learning
        together.  However, using code to make a project come to life has become a passion
        of mine. I believe there is nothing as euphoric as the moment when I see
        something I created work as I intended.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am committed to gaining a well-rounded education and becoming the best
        developer possible.  Having no traditional training in computer science, I have
        enrolled in the Google IT Support Professional Certificate Program on Coursera
        and will seek the CompTIA A+ certification. I believe my eagerness to learn, previous
        experience with Lua, experience from previous careers, and passion for creating
        with code make me an excellent candidate for the position of Web Development Apprentice
        with thunder::tech.
